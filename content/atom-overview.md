# ATOM Overview

ATOM (Adaptive Telecom Operations Module) is a SolveForce system that organizes
telecom services, providers, and infrastructure into a coherent and extensible
model.

It is intended to become the reference definition of:

- How SolveForce names, categorizes, and describes services.
- How availability and coverage are mapped across geographies.
- How future AI, AMR, and data center integrations attach to telecom fabric.
